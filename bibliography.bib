  abstract  = {In recent years, Evolutionary Algorithms (EAs) have been remarkably useful to improve the robustness of Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs). This study introduces an experimental analysis using an EAs aimed to evolve ANNs architectures (the FS-EPNet algorithm) to understand how neural networks are evolved with a steady-state algorithm and compare the Single-step-ahead (SSP) and Multiple-step-ahead (MSP) methods for prediction tasks over two test sets. It was decided to test an inside-set during evolution and an outside-set after the whole evolutionary process has been completed to validate the generalization performance with the same method (SSP or MSP). Thus, the networks may not be correctly evaluated (misleading fitness) if the single SSP is used during evolution (inside-set) and then the MSP at the end of it (outside-set). The results show that the same prediction method should be used in both evaluation sets providing smaller errors on average.},

  abstract = {Memory complaints and deficits are common in patients with epilepsy, especially temporal lobe epilepsy (TLE), where memory-related brain structures are directly involved in the epileptic process. In recent years, substantial progress has been made in delineating memory impairment in TLE, challenging the traditional neuropsychological approach of the disorder. In particular, several lines of evidence have suggested that, beyond the apparent deficit demonstrable by standardized neuropsychological evaluations, TLE may also negatively interact with long-term memory, producing considerable loss of information of the patient's autobiographical history and an inability to maintain newly acquired information over a period of time. These observations have led to the development of innovative assessment techniques, and prompted a new domain of investigation focused on the relationships between interictal epileptiform activities and the integrity of anatomo-functional systems. The present paper reviews the available evidence for long-term memory deficits in TLE with respect to remote and very long-term memory, and discusses their putative pathophysiological mechanisms and the developing potential strategies to improve memory functioning.},
